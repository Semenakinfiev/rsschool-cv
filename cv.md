## About Me
I am 33 years old and I know what I want and how to achieve it... I want to finish the RS School course to get enough knowledge that will help me find my first job as a developer. Before I found RS School, I had been studying for a year at various free javascript courses. Thanks to the past year of self-study, I have a good idea of what I have to do in a real job and I understand that it is interesting to me. I also understand that I am diligent and smart enough to master the course program and obtain the necessary knowledge and skills.
